# Introduction
This is my coursework for term 1 year 1 programming module.

# Running the program
You will need Python & PyGame installed, versions I used are detailed [here](#version-information).

Either:
- Open project in IDE of choice and run `Main.py`
- Run the `Main.py` by opening with Python shell

# Version information
Python Version: `3.6.1`

PyGame Version: `1.9.3`

# What is it?
We had to use Python to produce a project of our choice.

I decided I wanted to use PyGame and so decided to recreate, in Python & PyGame, my coursework 2 piece for GCSE Computer Science that I completed in 2015.

My exam board was AQA and gave us the game outline.

## Original Outline
It was a two player game where each player had 2 counters, and their goal was to get board counters to the top row. The game consisted of 11 rows where rows 1, 5 and 11 are 'safe' rows, meaning that your counter cannot be knocked back from this location. If your counter landed on the same row an an opponent counter, the opponents counter would be knocked back to the START position. Once both of a players counters landed on the finish row, they would be considered the winner.

## Extras
I included the follow in this implemenation:
- Highscores
- Saving and loading a game
- Instructions screen
